### Description
  We are attempting to create a type-racing game, modeled after the game NitroType which you can find and play at nitrotype.com. To play, up to 4 players will join a game. The “race host” has the option to start when everyone is ready by pressing a button. After a short delay, users will type a paragraph of text selected randomly from a database as fast, and accurately as they can before the other players finish. Each player (not including bots) is given a boost that players can use once per game to skip a word. Statistics like words per minute and accuracy as well as positions will be displayed in real time.
